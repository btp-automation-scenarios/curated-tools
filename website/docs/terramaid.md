# Terramaid

## Intent

Terramaid transforms your Terraform resources and plans into Mermaid diagrams. These diagrams can improve the documentation and simplify review processes.

## Problem

Terraform code and plans can become complex and hard to understand. An appealing visualization of these artifacts is not in scope of the Terraform/OpenTofu CLI. However, teams working with Terraform often demand a visual representation of their infrastructure as code to improve the documentation and simplify review processes.

## Solution

**Terramaid** is a CLI tool that transforms Terraform resources and plans into Mermaid diagrams that is a commonly used format for diagrams based on markdown. The tool offers several options e.g. offers the creation of different chart types.

It can be used for generating diagrams form existing Terraform code for documentation purposes or to improve the review process by generating diagrams from Terraform plans.
