# Overview

This page is a curated collection fo tools when using Terraform or OpenTofu to automate the provisioning and management of infrastructure.

Althought the CLI tools for Terraform and OpenTofu already provide a solid foundation for Infrastructure as Code (IaC), there are several white spaces that can be filled with additional tools to enhance productivity, streamline workflows, and improve the overall user experience.

This site presents several tools that we use and think are useful. The list should not be considered complete and we welcome contributions to expand and improve the collection.

Before satrting with selecting and introducing tools we highly recommend to take a closer look at your overall setup in your organization. A good starting point from a methodological perspective is the [Terraform Well Architected Framework](https://developer.hashicorp.com/well-architected-framework). This framework provides guidance on best practices and principles for designing, building, and maintaining secure, reliable, and efficient infrastructure using Terraform. However be aware that some statements target Hashicorps commercial offerings and may not be applicable for you.
