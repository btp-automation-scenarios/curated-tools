# Provider Supported Actions

## Intent

The intent of the tool/repository is to provide an overview of which Terraform providers support which actions and search capabilities.

## Problem

With the upcoming release of Terraform 1.14 two new features will be available in public beta:

- Terraform Actions
- Terraform Search/List

These features are not yet widely adopted by the providers and it is hard to find out which provider supports which actions and search capabilities.

## Solution

The repository [extract-provider-supported-actions](https://github.com/quixoticmonk/extract-provider-supported-actions) provides a list of providers and their supported actions and search capabilities.

The list is automatically generated by extracting the information from the provider documentation. It is also automatically updated on a regular basis using GitHub Action workflows.
